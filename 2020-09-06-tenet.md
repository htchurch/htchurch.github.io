# Tenet (Christopher Nolan, 2020)
#### September 6, 2020
Never has a spy seemed so clueless--outside of parody--as John David Washington's "Protagonist," one of Chris Nolan's several pretentious meta-genre conceits in Tenet. Our nameless Protagonist seems for the most part to have fallen off the turnip truck just yesterday, a flat response to everything hurled towards him, from time-travel to a predicament which one character calls "worse than nuclear holocaust."

Washington's face doesn't read indescribable, in that he's enigmatic; he just seems bored. Even some of Nolan's most clever lines--like Washington's reply to Michael Caine, "You overestimate my powers of seduction," which both teases James Bond's canonical lustiness and racist black American stereotypes--appear on Washington's face as though he were breaking bad news to someone.

I got a headache from this movie.

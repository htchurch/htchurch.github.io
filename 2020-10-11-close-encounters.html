<h2>Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg, 1977)</h2>
    
    <p>
    The fixation on technology as the sole manufacturer of movie “magic” in Hollywood is probably worse than it’s ever been, so it’s shocking to see, through Steven Spielberg’s third feature Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), that there existed a time when such a fascination with spectacle actually furthered the humanist imagination.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Close Encounters sees power company employee Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) and single mother Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) experience strange, obsessive visions after the arrival of apparently extra-terrestrial beings, who descend upon the Malick-like dusty Midwest fields of Muncie, Indiana. Suburbanite Roy’s intense fascination with his UFO encounter leaves half his face tanned—and with visions of a strange organic shape—while Jillian’s son Barry, who serves as the film’s second hero, is lured by the starships and disappears into the clouds.</p>
    
    <p>
    But Spielberg’s sense of pro-human filmmaking doesn’t render a totally culture-blind picture: Roy’s obsession not only drives his family apart, but it also tortures him, as he waits for the strange shape—a pyramidal form that represents divine providence—to finally make sense. The same goes for Barry, whose child’s wonder at the UFOs invokes his own joy for toys (“Toys! Toys! Toys!” he yells). The various reactions of the Muncie townspeople to the unprecedented events happening before them provide a spectrum across which human belief exists—like the thought that gets slowly burned into the face of Roy’s wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) that her husband might have really just gone insane, which Spielberg pokes fun at with one man’s tall tale about Bigfoot. As the two families are torn apart, Roy’s and Barry’s predicaments provide us with both the incomprehensible wonder—and horror—of technology.
    </p>
    
    <p>So as a UFO investigation team, headed by French scientist Claude Lacombe (played here by perhaps American cinema’s most influential proponent, François Truffaut, in the only English-speaking role he ever did), head to Muncie to investigate the series of disturbances, Lacombe’s act of cross-cultural witnessing—from Mexico to India to America—breaks down both cultural and language barriers, as he soon discovers that the events unfolding before him aren’t meant for him to experience.</p> 
        
    <p>It’s why he tells Roy, “I envy you”; he’s found himself disallowed from the transcendent experiences of Roy, Barry, and Jillian, but he’s more than willing to believe in something he hasn’t experienced himself. This is the essence of the cinematic experience and, importantly, it’s also at the core of religious belief, what most would call faith.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Spielberg’s Judeo-Christian allegories have always been enlightening and, like the wonderful cross images in Amistad (1997), the 9/11 allegory of the omniscient PreCogs in Minority Report (2002), as well as, well, the entirety of A.I. (2001), his sense of Americanism stems from those shared universal values that connect us all—no matter what religion, culture, or language we profess. That sense of humanism, now rare, speaks a language that anyone can understand, the kind of humanism that artists like Truffaut championed and was fully realized in the ‘70s, perhaps the best decade for American movies yet.

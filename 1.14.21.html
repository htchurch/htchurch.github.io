      <h1>1.14.21</h1>
<pre>
    unsure & unfounded;
    commiserated
    instead.
    
    a beatitude
    undivined;
    statutes & laws.
    
    but that is all dogs do.
    a heeler or my palm:
    someone is God
    
    for the next two thousand years;
    I will read The Gospels without
    waiting for the time to come
    
    that some plastic set
    of words will hail down,
    but I donâ€™t think it will yet.
    
    there, on the map,
    there is a legend,
    there is a territory
    
    which embraces a border,
    within which you may travel,
    though I am unsure of it now.

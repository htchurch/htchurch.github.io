      <h1>1.14.21</h1>
<pre>
    A beatitude
    undivined in
    statutes & laws.
    
    But that is all dogs do.
    A heeler, His palm:
    someone is God
    
    for the next two thousand years;
    I will read The Gospels without
    waiting for the time to come,
    
    when on a crackling path
    the New Word will hail down
    & arrange the world
    
    there on this map.
    There is a legend,
    there is a territory,
    
    which embraces a border,
    along which you may trek,
    although it is unsure now,

    all the paths washed away,
    in mud, unsure & unfounded,
    commiserated instead.

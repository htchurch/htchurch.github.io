# Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)
#### February 29, 2020
Inside the ethical dilemmas tied to the myth of Hollywood, Lynch contorts genre(s) to show how bizarre Hollywood is and uses pop culture to find a moral center.

In Mulholland Drive, we see Hollywood as everyone else has seen it  and, simultaneously, as no one has seen it; Lynch's film warps Hollywood's cultural image with nostalgia without obfuscating its exploitative reputation.

This is to say that Lynch depicts Hollywood as only he sees it--auspicious palm trees, perky blonde-haired women (evoking Hollywood industry propaganda like Jean Negulesco's Alice in Movieland), helicopter-POV shots of the Hollywood sign, all-white couples dancing to Jitterbug (or, later, white and black couples singing "Sixteen Reasons"), deep-focused esoteric corporate big-wigs controlling things from the shadows, meetings with executives picky about their espressos (like babies), casting couches that aren't quite casting couches.

This is all redeemed because Lynch uses pop culture--always subject to Lynch's nostalgia--as a moral center in Betty's dilemma. Club Silencio singer Rebekah Del Rio sings a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying,"" updating, recontextualizing and reframing Hollywood pop culture. Here Lynch's sense of pop culture captures Betty's doomed longing for Rita--a lesbian romance that Lynch's camera empathizes through an honest, universal feeling of sadness. The Club Silencio scene converges as a point where fiction meets reality, where dreams of stardom are made and shattered; it's the perfect analogy for L.A.

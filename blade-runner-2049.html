      <h1>Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)</h1>
      <p>As imperfect as it was, the original Blade Runner (1982) had an ingenuity to it. Noir, “cyberpunk,” and meta-consumerism formed that film’s dystopia. Ridley Scott’s advertising savvy turned that pulp nightmare into sci-fi chic. Mixing genres, those admittedly synthetic market inventions, nonetheless grounded all the humane elements of the super-advanced technology of trashworld Earth into something that was simultaneously glossy yet dirty, and at least barely human.

    <p>Skipping out on those pulpy genre roots, Blade Runner 2049’s design, contradistinctly, is elaborate and ornate. Things in the world shimmer, like at the Wallace Corporation, headed by boring psycho Niander (Jared Leto); or they look smoothed with a palette knife, like in the orange dust of Deckard's (Harrison Ford's) hideaway. The Villeneuve post-Earth skips trash for glam, more polished than demolished. Even then, the themes are largely the same, so the film’s fascination with technology, rather than psychology, economizes the depth of Blade Runner's oft-maligned original cut. So, if Blade Runner was blue, Blade Runner 2049 is orange, but aesthetics can only get you so far.

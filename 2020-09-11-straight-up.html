<h2>Straight Up (James Sweeney, 2019)</h2>
  
<p>A movie that is so of-this-moment that a lot of what it’s getting at is really more progressive than the so-called, lame-ass “progressives” who understand the world in a very rigid way, even if they claim to profess otherwise. Operating outside of the jizzed up world of Millenial and GenZ, Straight Up isn’t actually reactionary––though dumb Letterboxd reviewers would have you think so. No, what James Sweeney does here is actually expose how both contemporary and traditional models of relationships can fail to provide happiness or fulfillment. In that sense, the movie is progressive, in that Sweeney’s character, a mostly sexless OCD man who identifies as gay (then doesn’t––and that’s where a lot of the quippy humor happens), attempts to bridge these disparate worlds together. What Sweeney finds out is that relationships are a lot deeper than sex (obvious), but also that relationships aren’t about finding “love” either; they’re about not being alone, he finds, but his best move––the one that makes the movie work so well––is turning that revelation into something humanistic.

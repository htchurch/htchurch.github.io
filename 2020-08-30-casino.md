# Casino (Martin Scorcese, 1995)
#### August 30, 2020
Past 1980-something Scorsese seems to have kept hitting repeat on his work. The question I have is, what do you get here that you don’t get––or rather, have already gotten––from his other mob movies, which take the glitz-glam of decadent gangster and covers it all in blood and turbulent romance—and sin. 

But there’s something particularly well-developed about Joe Pesci’s character though that moves what Scorsese has him usually do and makes him distinct from his usual shtick, that combination of hot-headedness and wise-assery that makes a Joe Pesci performance so movie-stealing; only now, Pesci has the capacity for romantic feeling, as we see in his affair with Ginger (Sharon Stone).

There are just so many storytelling devices here that were done because the meat of this movie is boring––the wise-ass, Pescian violence-humor; the overbearing voiceover; the ethnic conflict that is really just greed. That these tough guys have the capacity for emotions that aren’t anger isn’t impressive.

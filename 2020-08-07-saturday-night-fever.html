<h2 style="text-align: center">Saturday Night Fever (John Badham, 1977)</h2>
  
<p>Obviously, the best scenes are the dance scenes, which shine and sparkle with that machismo and glam that you’d make the 70s to be, so Travolta’s rambunctious teenager can dance like the rooster he’s meant to be––at least in his mind. The dancing is something to do to get you where you’re really meant to; you might dread the slow days of working, but on the weekend the pent-up physicality contained by drudgery can be let loose. That this film understands this makes it a very fun film, even if the ending is blah and the love interest is blah.

      <h1>1.18.21</h1>
<pre>
Broken blossoms,
descending the tree,
flowing petals
wandering free
in the orange sky,
like falling leaves&mdash;

January was never
this tumultuous,
heading into spring&mdash;
glowing phosphorous.
The reddest cherry.
The red robin is
the reddest berry;
itâ€™s preposterous,

like the wind cooling
an apple pie in the window,
only to be led astray
by the pink flamingo,
dining on plankton shrimp
off Santo Domingo;

by an ocean of jewels,
an ocean of plastic,
a floating paradise.

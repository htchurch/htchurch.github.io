    <title>Pi</title>
    <link>https://www.htchurch.xyz/blog#26</link>
    <description>So rough-edged and clearly Aronofsky's first film even if you hadn't been told that ahead of time, Pi (or π if you like) is also his best film, part schizo-collage like Requiem for a Dream but also the first to feature one of his mentally ill obssessives who push it too far like in The Wrestler, The Black Swan, and, I guess, Noah. Of course the film's subtle critique of Jewish paranoia is provoking, but it's at the cost of the film's worst move: Pi rudely conflates religious wonderment with mental frailty. In the end we're not supposed to see any order in the world — it's all random, allegedly — and nothing means nothing. Aronovsky never really evolves from there, does he?</description>

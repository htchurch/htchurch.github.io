    <p>April 6, 2021</p>

    <p>
      Ridley Scott by 1992, 500 years after Columbus did you-know-what: pretty,
      usually, but also, usually, pretty unpleasant. Reviewers not pleased with
      the depiction of Columbus should probably grow up, but
      <em>The New World</em> (2005) this is not.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-deep-blue-sea-the-day-after-wall-street">
      The Deep Blue Sea, The Day After, Wall Street
    </h2>

    <p>April 5, 2021</p>
    <p>
      Tom Hiddleston (Amerimutts will know him as tricky Loki in the
      <em>Marvel</em> capeshit “movies”) in Terence Davies’
      <em>The Deep Blue Sea</em> (2011) doesn’t disappoint, but Rachel Weisz and
      her pathetic 12-aspirin suicide attempt seem more laughable than serious —
      and ambivalent, which is how Mr. Davies feels about love, but even if he’s
      not so convinced about it, Weisz doesn’t exactly help things by being so
      maudlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Day After</em> (1983) was a made-for-TV movie about the end of the
      world where Kansas and Missouri get blown to Hell, where old people make
      side remarks about the Cuban Missile Crisis and how this time will be the
      same, all right before they’re holocausted. Cold War torture porn, midwest
      fundamentalist apocalypticism for the Reagan era that is, overall, pretty
      fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Wall Street</em> (1987) has Charlie Sheen and his union dad (eyeroll)
      take on stogie-smoking Michael Douglas in a film in which I am supposed to
      think Darryl Hannah is a hot babe and which I am also supposed to
      understand how the stock market works and Oliver Stone’s mission to take
      on the Big Guys, only I learned that liberals probably loved this, and
      that all the Reagan-era narcissism was, in their minds, presumably shoved
      onto Trump. Wait ‘til they learn about Goldman Sachs’ “Womyn in
      International African Loans” program. Capitalism is about shapeshifting.

    <h2 id="toc_1">Love &amp; Friendship</h2>

    <p>February 24, 2021</p>

    <p>
      <em>Love and Friendship</em>, starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan
      Vernon, formerly an Austen character whose noble title only describes her
      social rank reminds me that Mr. Whit Stillman is a rare breed of
      filmmaker: he&rsquo;s neither insane, nor self-obsessed, but he&rsquo;s
      also, fittingly, witty and precise. His observations about human behavior
      are mostly satire; that&rsquo;s been his mode in all of his films, and
      it&rsquo;s clear by now that Jane Austen &mdash; genius satirist &mdash;
      inspires him greatly. Lady Susan, like many other of Stillman&rsquo;s
      well-to-do characters, casually slips between the role of the satirist and
      the object of satire. It&rsquo;s through her that Stillman calls America a
      &ldquo;nation of ingrates&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s the type of line that cuts
      right through the spoiled insanity that runs through our nation. It leaves
      the crazies fuming and the reasonable and pleasant satisfied. That means
      it&rsquo;s one of his best, one of his most timely. She&rsquo;s a jealous
      woman, manipulative and cunning too, but we can&rsquo;t forget that her
      environment encourages her behavior &mdash; and that&rsquo;s the
      film&rsquo;s Stillmanian wit coming out, if you can catch it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_2">Paterson</h2>

    <p>February 22, 2021</p>

    <p>
      Adam Driver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paterson&rdquo; and Jim Jarmusch&rsquo;s
      <em>Paterson</em> suffer the problem of timidity. Paterson, a secret poet,
      writes poems about matches, his girlfriend, in solitude. He drives a bus
      for a living, so he figures himself a bus driver only. His girlfriend
      (Golshifteh Farahani) encourages his work, and he encourages hers &mdash;
      though not with the same enthusiasm as she does with his. She&rsquo;s a
      visual artist, a baker, and, curiously, wants to be a country singer.
      &ldquo;Like Patsy Cline,&rdquo; she says. Farahani&rsquo;s depiction is so
      eccentric and kooky that, I imagine, Jarmusch wants to make you feel bad
      if you doubt her delusions (which the film continually confuses as
      &ldquo;dreams&rdquo;).
    </p>

    <p>
      If Driver&rsquo;s Paterson really is so closed off from the world
      (Jarmusch likes to go back to a photo of Driver in military uniform), one
      wonders why he ever decided to pick up the pen. Why write? How the hell
      did he get into David Foster Wallace? These questions remain unresolved;
      you&rsquo;re not meant to question their veracity. That&rsquo;s a more
      interesting subject than his own relation to himself as an
      &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; and one can&rsquo;t but help think that Jarmusch
      thought that answering the latter would answer the former. It certainly
      doesn&rsquo;t.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it would be wrong to suggest that Paterson the poet &mdash;mystically
      encouraged by a Japanese businessman&mdash;would come to embody Paterson
      the place just by word association. Paterson guards his talents in a way
      that the city doesn&rsquo;t; in fact, the film shows a city blooming with
      talent, people with beautiful souls, who come to be more than they seem.
      Does Paterson&rsquo;s presumptions about these people &mdash; which are,
      it is implied, quickly assuaged by simply talking &mdash; come from
      Paterson or Jarmusch? This is just to say that where Paterson ends and
      Jarmusch begins isn&rsquo;t clear. But Paterson is Paterson, just not in
      the way you might think. Mostly, Jim Jarmusch wants you to know he&rsquo;s
      cool, that his characters are cool. So cool, mind you, that they
      can&rsquo;t quite process their emotions in a way that&rsquo;s relatable
      &mdash; or inviting &mdash; to his viewers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_3">The Long Day Closes</h2>

    <p>February 18, 2021</p>

    <p>
      When the protagonist’s mother (Marjorie Yates) in Terence Davies’
      <em>The Long Day Closes</em> sings “Me and My Shadow” to her son, the
      blossoming and peculiar Bud (Leigh McCormack), her words lie down deep
      inside her. Not seeking escape so much as expression, she finds herself
      respite in her son, “all alone and feeling blue,” and by that point we
      already know that young Bud feels the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The Long Day Closes</em> is the first film I’ve seen from British
      director Terence Davies, and I saw it mostly on the recommendation of
      Armond White, who called it “<a
        href="https://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2014/07/23/armond-white-long-day-closes-greatest-gay-film-ever-made?pg=full"
        >the greatest gay film ever made</a
      >.” I’d be hard pressed to disagree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Davies&#39; Bud, an 11-year old in 1950s Liverpool, discovers he&rsquo;s
      gay in a moment that&rsquo;s particular &mdash; but also peculiar &mdash;
      to gay men: staring out his working-class apartment onto the street, he
      catches the eye of a bricklayer, who winks at him. It&rsquo;s a moment of
      pleasure and pain; the moment reads on Bud’s face as a realization that
      he’s enraptured, but with the pain that accompanies the isolation of what
      it used to mean to be queer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bud is always around his mother, an older widow with several older
      children, but her connection to Bud seems closer. Sitting on the couch
      with Bud, their fingers intertwine; she cries, and Davies’ memory of her
      tears becomes another memory of rain, like when Bud tries to get money
      outside the cinema. One can’t but help wonder if her tears are a silent
      acknowledgment of Bud’s peculiarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Davies understands well the dynamics of gay life, even for a young boy. In
      a scene at a carnival, Bud’s brothers take up BB gun shooting, while Bud
      follows his sister, eating a cotton candy. There’s rapport, like when
      Bud’s mom asks him, “Do you prefer havin’ nits?” But Bud’s family’s
      acceptance of his individuality — the way he washes his brother’s back,
      the way he buys his sister perfume and laughs in harmony with the girls —
      gently dissolves the temptation to pathologize that seems to guide our
      current culture. When Bud’s mother sings “If I Had My Life to Live Over,”
      it’s all love, all feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Davies knows, too, the way the gay imagination is guided by pop culture,
      the way the gay imagination plays with and subverts it — he knows, too,
      that we’re all guided by it. Bud’s daydreams picture a vast world outside
      Liverpool: first he sees a ship, sailing on the sea; then he’s full of
      wonder at the clouds in the sky, and God. The film’s now-famous “Tammy”
      sequence is its best: as Debbie Reynolds’ voice sets the mundane montage
      of Bud’s life, it captures perfectly the loneliness typical of a longing
      young boy, but it also suggests the specific feminine identification of
      all gay men.
    </p>

    <p>
      Davies grounds the film — and Bud’s understanding — in pop culture memory,
      those movies and songs that carry the experience of what academics would
      call <em>jouissance</em>; the moment when the pleasure principle meets
      identification, leading to a distinctly emptying transgression of pleasure
      and pain. It’s why the daydreams about sailing on the open sea and staring
      at the vastness of the stars is accompanied by a nightmare: a man reaches
      out, grabs Bud, and steals him away. That’s every child’s (and parent’s)
      fear, but it takes on a queer tone, too, in every gay man’s fear of coming
      out. This film is sublime.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_4">The Thin Red Line</h2>

    <p>February 14, 2021</p>

    <p>
      Terrence Malick&rsquo;s <em>The Thin Red Line</em> (1998) is brutal.
      Consider Malick&rsquo;s well-known predilection for soft frames filled
      with beauty and one would think, at first, that the barbarity of war would
      reduce or muddle this softness. One assumes the fields of grass will fold
      under an Army book. Not so: Malick mixes together moments of humane,
      conscious film-making and moral courage inside what is otherwise Hell,
      like a war film must.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn&rsquo;t a techno-fest of blood and guts like Sam Mendes&#39;
      horrible <em>1917</em> (2019), in which there are no spoils of war, it
      turns out, and that is the greatest tragedy of all, apparently. No;
      Malick&rsquo;s operating on a different level — not so much as a
      pop-auteur, like his 1998 war-film colleague Steven Spielberg; instead,
      Malick uses the camera to film soldiers in amazement and horror, often
      misinterpreted as &ldquo;sublimity.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s what the
      soldiers say and do that matters more. Their bravery, such as John
      Cusack&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s flanking of five Japanese gunners,
      invokes humanism just as much as the sometimes highfalutin dialogue,
      though its some of the best ever put in a war film.
    </p>

    <p>
      Malick reaches across enemy lines, too, like Spielberg was scared to do in
      <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> and Mel Gibson kind of did in
      <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> (2016) — except better. This sequence starts with a
      Japanese soldier&rsquo;s face in the dirt; mist fills the screen, tempting
      the sublime, but the effect is ghostly, and the soldier&rsquo;s dead-POV
      voice-over speaks:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Are you righteous? Kind? Does your confidence lie in this? Are you loved
        by all? Know that I was, too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be
        less because you loved goodness? Truth?
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Malick cuts to a soldier&rsquo;s face (Jim Caviezel of Gibson&rsquo;s
      <em>Passion of the Christ</em> fame) then to a roaring fire on the
      hillside. Caviezel&rsquo;s character, Pvt. Witt, goes AWOL at the
      beginning of the film and lives among the indigenous population.
      He&rsquo;s a more humane version, if not less cynical, of Stanley
      Kubrick&rsquo;s Joker (played by Matthew Modine). Now he&rsquo;s been cast
      into the fire. This is Malick&rsquo;s recognition that there is no beauty
      to be found in war, in the inhumanity of politics. It&rsquo;s a
      recognition that doesn&rsquo;t absolve us of politics. One character
      speaks an uncomfortable truth, and it almost gets lost beneath the fury of
      gunfire: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all for property!&rdquo; More for property than
      God (or good) that is, which seems to be Malick&rsquo;s point.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_5">Sounder</h2>

    <p>February 9, 2021</p>

    <p>
      <em>Sounder</em> is one of the best American films ever made. Set in the
      sharecropping South — now understood in contemporary history as the cousin
      of slavery and white supremacy — the story is simple: a father steals a
      pig to feed his family; he is caught and sent away; the son looks for him,
      meets a kind teacher, and returns without his father; through God&rsquo;s
      grace, or mere happenstance, he returns, and demands his son get an
      education. The film&rsquo;s emotion and weight is carried by performances
      by the recently-departed Cicely Tyson, whose Rebecca is tested by cruelty
      and hardship, yet is stronger than it all through faith and love, as well
      as Paul Winfield&rsquo;s wisened humility hubris, upon whom the film
      inflicts most of the physical pain, save for Sounder the dog. These are
      characters whose history we can read on their faces; yet their charm and
      humor and wisdom is always deeper than their pain, and we, the audience,
      soon realize that, after Nathan (Winfield&rsquo;s character) returns from
      a labor camp almost crippled, that they already have, by experience,
      intuited the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, spoken from the heart by the kind
      teacher Ms. Camille (Myrl Sharkey). Their pain runs deep but their love
      for each other runs deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like all classic, timeless films, Martin Ritt&rsquo;s <em>Sounder</em> is
      not, also, a perfect film. But it is an amazing, moving film about love
      and struggle — as simple as that may sound — that is made even richer, and
      deeper, because it&rsquo;s a film that puts truth above all else. Like
      <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, <em>Nashville</em>,
      <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, <em>Sounder</em> is a
      vital film in the American film art tradition; you&rsquo;d be missing out
      a lot if you neglected it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_6">The Deer Hunter</h2>

    <p>February 2, 2021</p>

    <p>
      I just yesterday watched The Deer Hunter (1978), directed by Michael
      Cimino and starring Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep.
      I posted my take on it on my Letterboxd, but I will post the review here,
      too:
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the biggest complaints about this movie that is totally fair to
      lodge — that isn&rsquo;t about it being too long, a side effect of
      over-diagnosed ADHD Letterboxd brains — is that the highs of this movie
      are so great, and Cimino&rsquo;s direction is so brilliant in parts, and
      all of the actors are doing their best, considering that their characters
      aren&rsquo;t much to work with, truthfully, but the movie, while anti-war,
      really and truly doesn&rsquo;t know what kind of moral attitude it really
      wants to have about all the totally brutal scenes that happen during the
      middle of the film. It&rsquo;s oddly structured, with a too Romantic jump
      from total terror, with the escape from a Vietnamese torture camp to the
      awkward sexual chastity back in middle America.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cimino&rsquo;s steel town middle Americans experience the terror of war
      and people so foreign to them they&rsquo;re alien (It is not bleeding
      heart liberalism to suggest that the Vietnamese of this film are portrayed
      in a particularly harsh way, at least I don&rsquo;t think.) But this is a
      wonderful film, honestly on-par with the much-lauded
      <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, if only because we aren&rsquo;t allowed to see a
      civilian world in <em>Apocalypse Now</em> — where [as
      <a
        href="https://disquietthoughts.blogspot.com/2007/11/baudrillard-on-apocalypse-now.html"
        >Baudrillard</a
      >
      suggests] Coppola is caught up in the spectacle of war — in The Deer
      Hunter the spacious world from America to Vietnam becomes a testament to
      the spaciousness of our own capabilities under the heart of darkness.
      Perhaps the brutality of De Niro&rsquo;s character in Vietnam is a
      extrapolation of his pent-up sexual energies. If only Cimino was able to
      articulate a position more fully developed, then who knows, maybe more
      people would talk about The Deer Hunter like they do about Apocalypse Now,
      but what&rsquo;s here is already pretty near great. Cimino&rsquo;s vision
      is astounding.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_7">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</h2>

    <p>October 11, 2020</p>

    <p>
      The fixation on technology as the sole manufacturer of movie
      &ldquo;magic&rdquo; in Hollywood is probably worse than it&rsquo;s ever
      been, so it&rsquo;s shocking to see, through Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s
      third feature film <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> (1977),
      that there existed a time when such a fascination with spectacle actually
      furthered the humanist imagination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Close Encounters sees power company employee Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss)
      and single mother Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) experience strange,
      obsessive visions after the arrival of apparently extra-terrestrial
      beings, who descend upon the Malick-like dusty Midwest fields of Muncie,
      Indiana. Suburbanite Roy&rsquo;s intense fascination with his UFO
      encounter leaves half his face tanned-and with visions of a strange
      organic shape-while Jillian&rsquo;s son Barry, who serves as the
      film&rsquo;s second hero, is lured by the starships and disappears into
      the clouds.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Spielberg&rsquo;s sense of pro-human filmmaking doesn&rsquo;t render a
      totally culture-blind picture: Roy&rsquo;s obsession not only drives his
      family apart, but it also tortures him, as he waits for the strange
      shape-a pyramidal form that represents divine providence-to finally make
      sense. The same goes for Barry, whose child&rsquo;s wonder at the UFOs
      invokes his own joy for toys (&ldquo;Toys! Toys! Toys!&rdquo; he yells).
      The various reactions of the Muncie townspeople to the unprecedented
      events happening before them provide a spectrum across which human belief
      exists-like the thought that gets slowly burned into the face of
      Roy&rsquo;s wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) that her husband might have really
      just gone insane, which Spielberg pokes fun at with one man&rsquo;s tall
      tale about Bigfoot. As the two families are torn apart, Roy&rsquo;s and
      Barry&rsquo;s predicaments provide us with both the incomprehensible
      wonder-and horror-of technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      So as a UFO investigation team, headed by French scientist Claude Lacombe
      (played here by perhaps American cinema&rsquo;s most influential
      proponent, François Truffaut), head to Muncie to investigate the series of
      disturbances, Lacombe&rsquo;s act of cross-cultural witnessing — from
      Mexico to India to America — breaks down both cultural and language
      barriers, as he soon discovers that the events unfolding before him
      aren&rsquo;t meant for him to experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      It&rsquo;s why he tells Roy, &ldquo;I envy you&rdquo;; he&rsquo;s found
      himself disallowed from the transcendent experiences of Roy, Barry, and
      Jillian, but he&rsquo;s more than willing to believe in something he
      hasn&rsquo;t experienced himself. This is the essence of the cinematic
      experience and, importantly, it&rsquo;s also at the core of religious
      belief, what most would call faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spielberg&rsquo;s Judeo-Christian allegories have always been enlightening
      and, like the wonderful cross images in <em>Amistad</em> (1997), the 9/11
      allegory of the omniscient PreCogs in <em>Minority Report</em> (2002), as
      well as, well, the entirety of <em>A.I.</em> (2001), his sense of
      Americanism stems from those shared universal values that connect us
      all-no matter what religion, culture, or language we profess. That sense
      of humanism, now rare, speaks a language that anyone can understand, the
      kind of humanism that artists like Truffaut championed and was fully
      realized in the &lsquo;70s, perhaps the best decade for American movies.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_8">Hacksaw Ridge</h2>

    <p>October 9, 2020</p>

    <p>
      In <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em>, the war scenes are terrifying, surreal,
      inspiring and maddeningly evil — none so effective as when a U.S. and
      Japanese soldier grab each other by their bare hands, in
      close-quarters-combat, only for an artillery strike to brutalize them. The
      spectacle of the representations in <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> make the bloody
      tolls of war not-quite-real through a constant haze of smoke and fire and
      bombs that cloak and disguise the sky, an inhumane abandonment of God.
      Through the acts of World War Two medic Donald Doss (Andrew Garfield), an
      unarmed Conscientious Objector who risks his life to save his fellow
      soldiers, director Mel Gibson reminds the rest of us-especially the
      Washington elite-of the basic denial of humanity, and the viciousness, of
      war.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the mass of bleeding soldiers, fighting for the U.S. and Japan,
      don&rsquo;t aim to distract as clichéd &ldquo;anti-war&rdquo; spectacle;
      they aim to universalize the calamity of war as yet another reminder of
      mankind&rsquo;s deeply savage capabilities. This is why the battlefield
      seems staged; a theater for the wars that take millions of innocent
      combatant lives and make the rich a lot of money, subjects about which
      lesser films pretend philosophical sophistication but which this film
      boldly eschews for deeply held religious conviction. Gibson cuts through
      this brutality with well-placed empathy, like in the scene where Doss
      soothes the pain of a bleeding, dying Japanese solider with morphine, a
      reminder of the quiet moments of humanism and empathy that wars
      don&rsquo;t allow.

    <p>
      In the recent war film <em>1917</em> (2019), Sam Mendes&rsquo; steady-cam,
      on-rails, one-take trickery only served to make war a visual experiment, a
      marvel of modern technology that expressed the current, status quo
      Hollywood arrogance and cynicism about sacrifice; the kind of sacrifice
      and personal commitment that most can&rsquo;t comprehend today, especially
      Hollywood and the media-class, who only understand it through the lens of
      their institutional nepotism. That kind of media-class vindictiveness Mel
      Gibson has come to know so well, and he cuts through the godless skies of
      Hollywood savagery with a noble, humane response to this era&rsquo;s
      ruthlessness — mostly unarmed.

    <p>September 29, 2020</p>

    <p>
      One can’t help but think that Fritz Lang&rsquo;s 1927 film of the
      &ldquo;future&rdquo; of politics is greatly simplified to a really
      egregious point — even if it might have been made to appeal to
      working-class audiences. If this is propaganda for some sort of “workers’
      revolution,” one would think it pertinent to not make the proles so dull,
      that is, unthinking, or to make the film’s “workers” so ravenous and
      barbaric and easily manipulated. Of course, they can&rsquo;t help it, Lang
      suggests; they&rsquo;re under a magic spell from the bourgeoisie.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is truly wonderful imagery though, especially when Lang enters into
      occultist semiology — the inverted pentagram, the Whore of Babylon all
      strike the eye in an awe-inspiring way; they&rsquo;re dark reversals of
      science and “progress.&ldquo; Lang&rsquo;s biblical poetry is wonderful,
      but I get the sense he means it too literally. People, even the poor ones,
      have better morals than the bourgeoisie, and this film feels a bit too
      condescending when it talks about the Whore of Babylon, who stirs up all
      the lust of the workers. The workers are controlled by their desires, and
      the bourgeoisie is controlled by their desires, too, except workers want
      sex and bougie people want money. Maybe Lang is onto something, but the
      proles are smarter than you think. I’ll look elsewhere though if I want a
      smarter depiction of how the world works and how people act in it.

    <h2 id="toc_10">Babe: Pig in the City</h2>

    <p>September 23, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Despite the commercial success of the <em>Mad Max</em> films and the
      critical acclaim of the environmental propagandizing of
      <em>Happy Feet</em>, George Miller’s filmmaking was as never so precise —
      and artful — as it is in <em>Babe: Pig in the City</em>. In our current
      political moment, where revenge and enmity rule the political landscape —
      be it the professional anarchist class of wealthy, white, young people;
      ruling elites that break their own rules (like Nancy Pelosi’s secret spa
      day); or mob violence in the streets — Pig in the City answers our current
      political moment’s insanity with a small animal’s humanism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Set just moments after the events of <em>Babe</em>, where little pig Babe
      wins acclaim for his sheepherding talent (really his unique ability to
      empathize), <em>Pig in the City</em> raises the stakes with an accident
      that leaves Farmer Hoggett and his farm under threat of ruin by bankers. A
      generous appearance fee provokes Mrs. Hoggett and Babe to leave for the
      city — but not before animal hijinks throws her entire plan into disarray,
      leaving her and the pig strayed in the big city and their home in danger.
    </p>

    <p>
      In previous films, Miller’s political vision had never matched his kinetic
      frenzy. <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> tapped into obvious feminist themes,
      espousing questionable (yet predictable) radical-sympathizing politics,
      while <em>Happy Feet</em>’s obnoxious, bleeding-heart environmentalism
      goaded the Oscars to give him some attention. But the brilliance of
      <em>Pig in the City</em> is that Miller’s political commitments have never
      been less didactic: in this film, Miller’s filmmaking not only evokes
      populist themes; it’s mildly spiritual, and also clever.
    </p>

    <p>
      The animals at the simply labeled HOTEL where Babe and Mrs. Hoggett stay
      embody sympathetic human failures and their outcomes, like the mistreated
      pink poodle prostitute or the disabled, purblind Flealick, an aggressive,
      wheelchair-bound Jack Russell terrier. Though they all distinguish
      themselves by their animality, their proximity to human guile and folly
      gives them qualities that distinguish them from the stratified farm
      animals that filled the first film.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, empathy isn’t simplified. The film’s best subplot involves
      Thelonious (brilliantly voiced by James Cosmo), an orangutan whose
      affected accent and distinguished get-up signify desires beyond basic
      animal instinct — the desire to become human; in humans, the tendency to
      social climb. These animals’ alienation both inspire the compassionate
      Babe to help while also forming recognizable human types that the audience
      can identify. That these eccentric pets aren’t so far away from the
      follies of humans is the point. They&rsquo;re eccentric, but so are
      humans. In <em>Pig in the City</em>, the unnamed city is a grab-bag of
      urban landscapes, blending Hollywood, New York, San Francisco, even
      Sydney, into a synecdoche that evokes all cities in all places. The focus
      here isn’t to romanticize the pastoral of the left-behind farm, where the
      film ends; instead, Miller’s focus is on urbanity’s ultra-capitalist, as
      well as spiritual, failures — those who are left behind, avoided, and
      forgotten.
    </p>

    <p>
      But <em>Pig in the City</em> is also about forgiveness. Far from the
      technical prowess of the rest of the film, which elevates its storybook
      construction, Miller’s best scene breaks through potentially maudlin
      material with genuinely moving animal empathy. After Babe saves his
      attacker, a bull terrier, from drowning, the terrier offers his collar as
      recompense; but when he laments, “A murderous shadow lies hard across my
      soul,” the film moves past the previous film’s one-note unsophistication
      into humane brilliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in this way, each new scene not only reveals new ways of seeing the
      world, using identifiable types and moral predicaments, but also new ways
      of seeing movies. Babe’s moral consistency in the film’s scenarios exposes
      the frailty of our own morality in everyday situations. What we at first
      might have confused in Babe the pig for childish naïveté Miller reveals as
      ethics, a concern for the well-being others that religious believers take
      seriously, which is abused by our powerful elites.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the last decade, moviegoers endured — and eventually succumbed to —
      Marvel-movie insanity. Now in the era of streaming, filmmakers look to
      cash-in on its conditioned audience with pointless movies that indulge the
      neuroses of the filmmaker, like Charlie Kaufman’s most recent worst film,
      <em>I&rsquo;m Thinking of Ending Things</em>. Today&rsquo;s filmmakers
      propagate our always-current political problem of solipsism. As fewer good
      movies are made, and more of our political discourse revolves around
      violence and revenge, it’s always good to remember a time when political
      and moral values could influence good art.

    <h2 id="toc_11">Cookie&rsquo;s Fortune</h2>

    <p>September 19, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Catfish enchilada-flavored little comedy with clever parallels to
      <em>Salome</em> (I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet) that ends with tragic irony
      — yet it’s relentlessly funny. Insightful in the way that Altman reveals
      the complicated genealogy of people in the South,
      <em>Cookie’s Fortune</em> shows the connections that might seem totally
      unlikely anywhere else, informed by a regrettable history that is quickly
      being remedied through love. Just like the defense offered by Ned
      Beatty&rsquo;s Lester Boyle (&quot;I&rsquo;ve fished with him&rdquo;),
      it&rsquo;s a recognizable phrase that pays homage to the color-blindness
      of Southernness and brotherhood that needn&rsquo;t be so clearly
      bifurcated by political manipulations and past atrocities, that is, the
      legacy of racism. <em>Cookie’s Fortune</em> not only challenges the
      strictly white-black divisions that connote the South, but it also reveals
      insights into the bonds that anyone, anywhere can make — those complicated
      branches on the family tree.

    <h2 id="toc_12">Blade Runner 2049</h2>

    <p>September 19, 2020</p>

    <p>
      As imperfect as it was, the original <em>Blade Runner</em> (1982) had an
      ingenuity to it; noir, “cyberpunk,” and meta-consumerism formed that
      film’s dystopia. Ridley Scott’s advertising savvy turned that pulp
      nightmare into sci-fi chic. People hated the voice-over and the ending,
      but they had to admit that the film itself wasn&rsquo;t exactly a
      full-fledged vision from the beginning; it was a wonderful visionary
      concept that was rough around the edges but ultimately satisfying. Genre
      mixing, these admittedly synthetic market inventions, nonetheless grounded
      all the humane elements of the super-advanced technology of trashworld
      Earth into something that was simultaneously glossy yet dirty — and at
      least human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Skipping out on those pulpy genre roots, <em>BR2049</em>’s design,
      contradistinctly, is elaborate and ornate. Things in the world shimmer, or
      look smoothed with a palette knife. The <em>Blade Runner</em> world is a
      trash world. The Villeneuve post-Earth skips trash for glam. Even then,
      the themes are largely the same, when you get right down to it, but the
      film’s fascination with technology, rather than psychology, economizes the
      depth of Blade Runner&rsquo;s oft-maligned original cut. So, if the O.C.
      of Blade Runner was blue, <em>BR2049</em> is orange — but anyone who saw
      the original knows that aesthetics can only get you so far.

    <h2 id="toc_13">Freddy Got Fingered</h2>

    <p>September 15, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Insane, absurd, ridiculous, pointless, irrational. One of the most bold
      and tasteless movies ever released by a major motion picture studio
      (probably) — but, importantly, bold and tasteless doesn’t necessarily mean
      bad. Throughout the seemingly disconnected acts of 2000s-flavor absurdist,
      gross-out humor (and remember: humor is subjective) there is a totally
      conventional father-son-Hollywood storyline, but Tom Green’s sense of
      (anti)humor turns the film’s sexual vulgarity into revolting acts of
      carnal impudence — a 28-year-old’s coming-of-age story. There’s
      occasionally homage, with obvious nods to Buster Keaton and
      <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, invoking not only the spirit of Hollywood
      spectacle but the long history of cinema’s physical comedians and body
      humorists. Tom Green’s rebellion is pointless and retarded, insofar that
      the film’s insanity and mere existence is the joke, yet it’s hilarious,
      and as an art object <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em> is the kind of joke that
      only people with genuine counter-cultural interests will understand. Burn
      money the right way.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_14">Straight Up</h2>

    <p>September 11, 2020</p>

    <p>
      <em>Straight Up</em> (2020) is a movie that is so of-this-moment that a
      lot of what it’s getting at is really more progressive than the so-called,
      lame-ass “progressives” who understand the world in a very rigid way, even
      if they claim to profess otherwise. Operating outside of the jizzed up
      world of Millenial and GenZ, <em>Straight Up</em> isn’t actually
      reactionary, though dumb Letterboxd reviewers would have you think so.
      What James Sweeney does here is actually expose how both contemporary and
      traditional models of relationships can fail to provide happiness or
      fulfillment. Modern problems require modern solutions. In that sense, the
      movie is progressive, in that Sweeney’s character, a mostly sexless OCD
      man who identifies as gay (then doesn’t — and that’s where a lot of the
      quippy humor happens), attempts to bridge these disparate worlds together.
      What Sweeney finds out is that relationships are a lot deeper than sex
      (obvious), but also that relationships aren’t about finding “love” either;
      they’re about not being alone; but his best move — the one that makes the
      movie work so well — is turning that revelation into something humanistic.
      Sweeney shows the complexity of the world that leaves political and
      cultural propagandists totally perplexed.

    <h2 id="toc_15">Crumb</h2>

    <p>September 9, 2020</p>

    <p>
      There are limitations inherent in Terry Zwigoff&rsquo;s form of
      film-making — the documentary — in <em>Crumb</em>: we can tell that
      there’s more that these three brothers aren’t revealing about their
      obviously fucked-up childhood, which the film can&rsquo;t probe because
      it&rsquo;s dealing with real, screwed-up people. Maxon’s ascetic lifestyle
      cloaks a past of molesting women and violent seizures; Charles, whose
      pedophilic desires probably explain why he’s never had sex, and among the
      Crumb brothers seems to harbor the most violent fantasies; and Robert’s
      misogyny manifests itself most famously through his behemoth, sometimes
      headless, women. Eventually, this documentary becomes entirely about sex
      and art, and how art can provide a sort of “therapy” for sexually aberrant
      fantasies — the sort that Zwigoff helps us become intimately familiar
      with, especially with Robert, whose incestuous, racist, and misogynistic
      cartoons stimulate most of the movie’s thoughtful contemplations on the
      subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      The revelation for this documentary, then, passed through various critics
      and ex-lovers of Robert and the various interviews, is that the impetus of
      what Crumb’s twisted comix depict are on some level subconscious. Of
      course, this is not a remarkable discovery by any means, but by letting
      everyone simply talk, a picture is formed: Crumb’s dissatisfactions with
      the people around him, especially with America (he’s leaving with his wife
      and child for countryside France), is the result of a deeply disturbing
      childhood that soiled the images sold to him through mass-media
      advertising — the jilted fantasy that Crumb brazenly depicts in his
      fantastic deviant cartoons.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zwigoff’s good enough to remind us that Crumb’s antisocial behavior is
      on some level warranted, even if what actually motivates Robert isn’t
      entirely known to him, and disturbs us.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_16">Tenet</h2>

    <p>September 6, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Never has a spy seemed so clueless as John David Washington’s
      “Protagonist,” one of Chris Nolan’s several meta-genre conceits that are
      all poorly executed in <em>Tenet</em>. Our nameless Protagonist seems for
      the most part to have — if you would allow me to use a wonderful Southern
      phrase — fallen off the turnip truck just yesterday, a flat response to
      everything hurled towards him, from time-travel to a predicament which one
      character calls “worse than nuclear holocaust.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Washington’s face doesn’t read indescribable, in that he’s enigmatic,
      wiry; he just seems bored. Even some of Nolan’s most clever lines (like
      Washington’s reply to Michael Caine: You overestimate my powers of
      seduction.) which tease James Bond’s canonical lustiness and racist black
      American stereotypes, appear on Washington’s face as though he were
      breaking bad news to someone. It&rsquo;s an indication that Nolan himself
      perhaps didn’t intend such moments of cultural self-awareness, as
      brilliant as they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, of course, Nolan isn’t really concerned with politics or culture; he
      never really is. Once again, Nolan has attempted to fool audiences with a
      hack filmmaker’s technological spectacle. As time, Nolan’s crutch, moves
      both forwards and backwards, any overarching plot becomes moot. It
      doesn&rsquo;t work as well as it did in <em>Memento</em>, where Nolan
      succeeded, for the most part, in showing how knowledge (informed by time)
      creates morality. That’s because Nolan’s intricate plotting, which films
      like <em>Memento</em> required a delicate consideration of, here fall flat
      because Nolan’s pretends philosophical depth and enables braindead
      nihilism — a problem only exaggerated through his penchant for filmmaking
      brainfreezes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="toc_17">Casino</h2>

    <p>August 30, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Past 1980-something, Scorsese seems to have kept hitting repeat on his
      work. The question I have is, what do you get here that you don’t get from
      his other mob movies? They, too, take the glitz-glam of decadent gangster
      and covers it all in blood, turbulent romance, and sin. After
      <em>The Godfather</em>, directors have yet to turn gangster trash into
      gold like Coppola did.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there’s something particularly well-developed about Joe Pesci’s
      character though that moves what Scorsese has him usually do and makes him
      distinct from his usual shtick, that combination of hot-headedness and
      wise-assery that makes a Joe Pesci performance so movie-stealing; only
      now, Pesci has the capacity for romantic feeling, as we see in his affair
      with Ginger (Sharon Stone).
    </p>

    <p>
      There are just so many storytelling devices here that were done because
      the meat of this movie is boring: the wise-ass, Pescian violence-humor;
      the overbearing voiceover; the ethnic conflict that is really just greed.
      That these tough guys have the capacity for emotions that aren’t anger
      isn’t impressive.

    <h2 id="toc_18">Polytechnique</h2>

    <p>August 26, 2020</p>

    <p>
      The obvious comparison one will immediately want to make is Van Sant’s
      <em>Elephant</em>, because this is about a school shooting, but at least
      <em>Elephant</em> understood the pointless, nihilistic violence of that
      act, The Columbine Massacre, which Van Sant rooted in the intersections of
      the sociopolitical. Instead, in <em>Polytechnique</em> Villeneuve
      foregrounds aesthetics: a black and white filter and ambient-piano score
      that tries to emphasize beauty over empathy — an aesthetic detachment from
      reality which many have misinterpreted as understanding. It’s not.

    <h2 id="toc_19">Saturday Night Fever</h2>

    <p>August 7, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Obviously, the best scenes are the dance scenes, which shine and sparkle
      with that machismo and glam that you’d make the 70s to be, so Travolta’s
      rambunctious teenager can dance like the rooster he’s meant to be, at
      least in his mind. The dancing is something to do to get you where you’re
      really meant to; you might dread the slow days of working, but on the
      weekend the pent-up physicality contained by drudgery can be let loose.
      That director John Badham understands this makes it a very fun film, even
      if the ending is blah and the love interest is blah.

    <h2 id="toc_20">Mulholland Drive</h2>

    <p>February 29, 2020</p>

    <p>
      Inside the ethical dilemmas tied to the myth of Hollywood, Lynch contorts
      genre(s) to show how bizarre Hollywood is and uses pop culture to find a
      moral center. In <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, we see Hollywood as everyone
      else has seen it and, simultaneously, as no one has seen it; Lynch warps
      Hollywood’s cultural image with nostalgia without obfuscating its
      exploitative reputation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is to say that Lynch depicts Hollywood as only he sees it —
      auspicious palm trees, perky blonde-haired women (evoking Hollywood
      industry propaganda like Jean Negulesco’s <em>Alice in Movieland</em>);
      helicopter-POV shots of the Hollywood sign; all-white couples dancing the
      Jitterbug (or, later, white and black couples singing “Sixteen Reasons”);
      deep-focused, esoteric corporate big-wigs controlling things from the
      shadows; meetings with executives picky about their espressos (like
      babies); casting couches that aren’t quite casting couches.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is all redeemed because Lynch uses pop culture — always subject to
      his nostalgia — as a moral center in Betty’s (Naomi Watts) dilemma. Club
      Silencio singer Rebekah Del Rio sings a Spanish version of Roy Orbison’s
      “Crying,” updating, recontextualizing and reframing Hollywood pop culture.
      Here Lynch’s sense of pop culture captures Betty’s doomed longing for
      Rita, a lesbian romance that Lynch’s camera empathizes through an honest,
      universal feeling of sadness. The Club Silencio scene converges as a point
      where fiction meets reality, where dreams of stardom are made and
      shattered; it’s the perfect analogy for L.A.

<h2 style="text-align: center">The Standoff at Sparrow Creek (Henry Dunham, 2018)</h2>

<p>Henry Dunham’s The Standoff at Sparrow Creek is a movie that will really infuriate ADHD crayon-eating Millennials for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of militia-men who are infiltrated by the police and goaded into believing that one of their own turned cop killer. Actually, it’s a little more psychologically probing than its influence Reservoir Dogs, because it understands that the desire to make the militia-men appear unequivocally evil resides in that part of the brain where everything is black-and-white.</p>
<p>This movie ponders, if only for one line, if it’s right that this is done at all, genuinely partaking in the act of politically-minded thinking. This is unlike Spike Lee’s Blackkklansman, which uncritically represents COINTELPRO subversion, towing the Democratic Party line once again. Millennial reviewers can’t handle this fact or Dunhman’s representations in this film. Too bad, however, that at 1hr 29min, there’s just not enough for the audience to chew on—so nothing here matches the drama and massive existential weight of a filmmaker like Craig Zahler, whose genre films exhalt moral ambiguity but run much longer, where there is Good and Evil and the person caught in-between in a world of people that intersects, is deadly and harsh and gray. The Standoff at Sparrow Creek just doesn’t have that grand scale, even if Dunham’s got his head in the right place.</p>

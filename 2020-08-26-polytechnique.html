<h2 style="text-align: center">Polytechnique (Denis Villeneuve, 2009)</h2>
  
 <p>The obvious comparison one will immediately want to make is Van Sant’s Elephant, because this is about a school shooting, but at least Elephant understood the pointless, nihilistic violence of that act, The Columbine Massacre, which Van Sant rooted in the intersections of the sociopolitical. Instead, in Polytechnique Villeneuve foregrounds aesthetics: a black and white filter and ambient-piano score that tries to emphasize beauty over empathy––an aesthetic detachment from reality which many have misinterpreted as understanding. It’s not.

# Music

All are CDs unless otherwise noted. Mostly due to cost but also space, I
don't collect LPs. I will usually spring for a digital album before an
LP, a CD before a digital album --- a cassette never.

For some albums, I have my own little ratings, which don't mean anything
to anyone except to me. The ones that don't have one are probably albums
I just haven't gotten to listen to yet, for one reason or another, which
usually means laziness.

They're sorted by alphabetical order, but with a small distinction: for
band names, those are sorted by the first letter of the first
significant word in the band's name (omitting the "the" in The Beach
Boys --- it's sorted by the "b" in "Beach" first, for example). For all
individual artists, they're sorted by last name. It's why Sonic Youth is
sorted before Weyes Blood.

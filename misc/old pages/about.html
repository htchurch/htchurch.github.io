      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Phantom Cinema is a blog dedicated to one thing: writing about the art of film. In our current moment the movie has been severely disregarded, its history abused, and its heroes forgotten. Unfortunately, the most significant forms of popular art has been turned into yet another commodity by the techno-cultural empire of Hollywood. Perhaps more than ever, not only are movies not-so-discreet forms of Hollywood social engineering, they're also, perhaps paradoxically, pure spectacle––signs upon signs upon signs that don't mean anything, yet they are blatantly political.</p>
        
        <p>Film critic Christian Metz once wrote that, at the cinema,</p>
        <blockquote>
        “[T]he activity of perception which it involves is real (the cinema is not phantasy), but the perceived is not really the object, it is its shade, its phantom, its double, its replica in a new kind of mirror.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Phantom Cinema understands that the Hollywood project has mostly failed, and as we turn into the phantom doubles of Hollywood's unthinking, ghoulish subjects, it's necessary more than ever that we reconsider film as more than just a politics-machine; it's art.</p>
            
            <p>That's not to say that this blog isn't afraid to talk about politics. Though it's now vogue in the counterculture to disregard politics in the same way we disregard Hollywood-movie spectacle, it's important to remember that, like Robert Altman reminded us in his masterpiece Nashville (1975), politics are everywhere. You just have to know where to look, how to see the phantom cinema.</p>

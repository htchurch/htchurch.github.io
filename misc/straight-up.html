      <h1>Straight Up (James Sweeney, 2019)</h1>
      <p>A movie that is so of-this-moment that a lot of what it’s getting at is really more progressive than the so-called “progressives” who understand the world in a very rigid, categorizing way, even if they claim to profess otherwise. Operating outside of the always-online world of Millenials and GenZ, Straight Up isn’t actually reactionary, though dumb Letterboxd reviewers would have you think so.</p>
      
      <p>No, what James Sweeney does here is actually expose how both contemporary and traditional models of relationships can fail to provide happiness or fulfillment. Sweeney’s character, Todd, a mostly sexless OCD man who identifies as gay (then doesn’t––and that’s where a lot of the quippy humor happens), attempts to bridge these disparate worlds together through his unconventional relationship with aspiring actress Rory (Katie Findlay), whose neurotic sensibilities match Todd's but aren't emasculating, just flustering.</p>
      
      <p>What Todd and Rory find out is that relationsips is a lot deeper than sex (obvious), but also that relationships aren’t about finding “love” either, at least not the "love" that gets advertised to us; they’re about not being alone, he finds, and his best move, the one that makes the movie work so well, is turning that revelation into something moving and funny. </p>

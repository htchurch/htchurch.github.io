    <h1><i>The Lives of Others</i> (2006)</h1>
    <h3>November 15 2020</h3>
    <p>People mad about the representations in this film as being not particularly realistic seem to be missing the point, which is that the melodrama of a censored playwright (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend (Martina Gedeck) under secret surveillance by the Stasi in a mid-80s German Democratic Republic (ha ha ha!) is only the emotional fodder for the film's strongest pull, in the spiritual awakening of a Stasi officer (a silent, stiff yet sensitive Ulrich Mühe) through the divine power of art—art so powerful that it breaks down the ideological barriers of an entrenched, devoted socialist. So sure, the film itself is not an aesthetic awakening—it probably doesn't represent the truth of Stasi oppression, in which case this story wouldn't exist—but the emotional core of the film carries its weight well. The Fassbinder world gets a soap opera touch. This film doesn't need history to confirm it as a good piece of art; it's sincere dedication to empathy does that on its own.</p>

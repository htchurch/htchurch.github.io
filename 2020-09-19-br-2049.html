<h2>Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)</h2>
  
<p>As imperfect as it was, the original Blade Runner (1982) had an ingenuity to it; noir, “cyberpunk,” and meta-consumerism formed that film’s dystopia. Ridley Scott’s advertising savvy turned that pulp nightmare into sci-fi chic. Genre mixing, these admittedly synthetic market inventions, nonetheless grounded all the humane elements of the super-advanced technology of trashworld Earth into something that was simultaneously glossy yet dirty––and at least human.

</p>

<p>Skipping out on those pulpy genre roots, BR2049’s design, contradistinctly, is elaborate and ornate. Things in the world shimmer, or look smoothed with a palette knife. The Villeneuve post-Earth skips trash for glam. Even then, the themes are largely the same, when you get right down to it, but the film’s fascination with technology, rather than psychology, economizes the depth of Blade Runner's oft-maligned original cut. So, if the OC of Blade Runner was blue, BR2049 is orange––but aesthetics can only get you so far.

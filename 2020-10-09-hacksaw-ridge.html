<h2 style="text-align: center">Hacksaw Ridge (Mel Gibson, 2016)</h2>

<p>In Hacksaw Ridge, the war scenes are terrifying, surreal, inspiring and maddeningly evil—none so effective as when a U.S. and Japanese soldier grab each other by their bare hands, in close-quarters-combat, only for an artillery strike to brutalize them. The spectacle of the representations in Hacksaw Ridge make the bloody tolls of war surreal through a constant haze of smoke and fire and bombs that cloak and disguise the sky, an inhumane abandonment of God. Through the acts of World War Two medic Donald Doss (Andrew Garfield), an unarmed Conscientious Objector who risks his life to save his fellow soldiers, director Mel Gibson reminds the rest of us—especially the Washington elite—of the basic denial of humanity, and the viciousness, of war.

</p>
<p>But the mass of bleeding soldiers, fighting for the U.S. and Japan, don’t aim to distract as clichéd “anti-war” spectacle; they aim to universalize the calamity of war as yet another reminder of mankind’s deeply savage capabilities. This is why the battlefield seems staged; a theater for the wars that take millions of innocent combatant lives and make the rich a lot of money, subjects about which lesser films pretend philosophical sophistication but which this film boldly eschews for deeply held religious conviction. Gibson cuts through this brutality with well-placed empathy, like in the scene where Doss soothes the pain of a bleeding, dying Japanese solider with morphine, a reminder of the quiet moments of humanism and empathy that wars don’t allow.

</p>
<p>In the recent war film 1917 (2019), Sam Mendes’ steady-cam, on-rails, one-take trickery only served to make war a visual experiment, a marvel of modern technology that expressed the current, status quo Hollywood arrogance and cynicism about sacrifice; the kind of sacrifice and personal commitment that most can’t comprehend today, especially Hollywood and the media-class, who only understand it through the lens of their institutional nepotism. That kind of media-class vindictiveness Mel Gibson has come to know so well, and he cuts through the godless skies of Hollywood savagery with a noble, humane response to this era’s ruthlessness—unarmed.

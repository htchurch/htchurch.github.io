<h2 style="text-align: center">Casino (Martin Scorsese, 1995)</h2>
  
<p>Past 1980-something Scorsese seems to have kept hitting repeat on his work. The question I have is, what do you get here that you don’t get––or rather, have already gotten––from his other mob movies, which take the glitz-glam of decadent gangster and covers it all in blood and turbulent romance—and sin.

</p>

<p>But there’s something particularly well-developed about Joe Pesci’s character though that moves what Scorsese has him usually do and makes him distinct from his usual shtick, that combination of hot-headedness and wise-assery that makes a Joe Pesci performance so movie-stealing; only now, Pesci has the capacity for romantic feeling, as we see in his affair with Ginger (Sharon Stone).

</p>

<p>There are just so many storytelling devices here that were done because the meat of this movie is boring––the wise-ass, Pescian violence-humor; the overbearing voiceover; the ethnic conflict that is really just greed. That these tough guys have the capacity for emotions that aren’t anger isn’t impressive.

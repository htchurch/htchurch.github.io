JB opens with a series of postcards, which are at once a little cutting and scornful but in an admittedly funny way—not in a way that reeks of JB's politics per se, but of an outsider who's come to visit, stayed for a little while and is reporting back to friends back home. I think of this section almost like Thomas Jefferson in France, in _Notes on Virginia_.

I do wonder whose religion JB is referring to when he suggests that a "terribly cruel religion" would have been needed "to exorcize such a theoretical grandeur as the deserts' geological and celestial occurrence, to live up to such a backdrop" (3). The Indians? The Mormons, whose architectural achievements in Salt Lake City he had just referred to as "pompous"? The Catholics? The Protestants?

He seems to suggest to that speed, which is, itself, a pure object, cancels out the present, the desert, but that doesn't stop what JB calls "fossil sounds" from awakening.

Baudrillard suggests a contrasting relationship between the U.S.' short-sightedness (speed) and its "primitiveness"—that is, its inherent rootlessness. Here Baudrillard posits that "speed is the triumph of effect over cause," a "rite" of nothingness that aims to bring the natural world back to immobility. (7)

For this, he focuses on the "rich-living, puritanical conquistadors, the Mormons" and the flatness of both space and time that high-speed cars seem to crush.

> Still, there is a violent contast here, in [the US], between the growing abstractness of a nuclear universe and a primary, visceral, unbounded vitality, springing not from rootedness, but from a lack of roots, a metabolic vitality, in sex and bodies, as well as in work and in buying and selling. Deep down, the US &hellip; is the _only remaining primitive society_. (7)

So, America is a place that negates and dissipates its own emptiness, its vast stretches of **land**. But the desert itself — and by extension, I suppose, forestry and trees, mountains and hills — is a "negative of the earth's surface and of our civilized humours." (6)

JB makes an observation which is a little confusing here but one that is worth considering—even if it really doesn't hold up historically:

> Only Puritans could have invented and developed this ecological andbiological morality based on preservation - and therefore on discrimination - which is profoundly racial in nature. Everything becomes an overprotected nature reserve, so protected indeed that there is talk today of denaturalizing Yosemite to give it back to Nature, as has happened with the Tasaday in the Philippines. A Puritan obsession with origins in the very place where the ground itself has already gone. An obsession with finding a niche, a contact, precisely at the point where everything unfolds in an astral indifference. (8)

Not sure what JB means when he talks about the so-called "efforts to denaturalize Yosemite to give it back to Nature" (8) since my sense of what "denaturalization" is counterintuitive to what I know JB must mean here, that America is "overprotective" of its nature because it is naturally

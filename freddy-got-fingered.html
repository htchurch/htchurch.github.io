      <h1>Freddy Got Fingered (Tom Green, 2001)</h1>
      <p>Insane, absurd, ridiculous, pointless, irrational. One of the most bold and tasteless movies ever released by a major motion picture studio (probably). But, importantly, bold and tasteless doesn’t necessarily mean bad. Throughout the seemingly disconnected acts of 2000s-flavor absurdist, gross-out humor (and remember: humor is subjective) that run 1h 27mins, there is a totally conventional father-son-Hollywood storyline, but Tom Green’s sense of (anti)humor turns the film’s sexual vulgarity into revolting acts of carnal impudence. It's a 28-year-old’s coming-of-age story. There’s occasionally homage, with obvious nods to Buster Keaton and Apocalypse Now, invoking not only the spirit of Hollywood spectacle but the long history of cinema’s physical comedians and body humorists. Tom Green’s rebellion is pointless, insofar that the film’s insanity is the point, yet it’s hilarious, and as an art object Freddy Got Fingered is the kind of joke that only people with genuine countercultural interests will understand.

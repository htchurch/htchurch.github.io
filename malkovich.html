      <p>Being John Malkovich, Spike Jonze’s debut film, represents a unique reformulation of Mulveyean film theory—a sophisticated, calculated implementation of pop cultural references and renegade feminist critique. It’s another trick in the music video prankster prodigy’s bag. Through surrealist comedy, taking Craig’s (John Cusack) ambition to be a world-class puppeteer seriously, Being John Malkovich re-presents film theory and film spectatorship in a postmodern, self-reflexive way, making high-concept, meta-level concerns about the displaced desires and misidentifications inherent in traditional film spectatorship accessible to a popular film audience. In diegesis, the film’s fantastical act of “being” the actor John Malkovich mirrors, in several ways, traditional film theory’s conception of how the film spectator views a film—sitting in a darkenedtheater and self-identifying with the male protagonist onscreen. However,
        by suggesting that Craig, the film’s solipsistic male protagonist, identifies
        with the feminine—represented by the film’s ending and a reference to William
        Luce’s The Belle of Amherst—Being John Malkovich also
        evokes <q>The Belle of Amherst,</q> Camille Paglia’s work on sadomasochism
        in the poems of Emily Dickinson, which suggests that the poet’s oeuvre
        concerns a self-identification outside the body. This essay argues that that
        Spike Jonze’s meta, self-reflexive and satirical representation of film theory
        in Being John Malkovich not only offers a salient cultural critique of
        celebrity worship; it also reorients traditional film viewership.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The act of entering the Malkovich body through a darkened tunnel,
        pimped-out by Craig and Maxine, replicates the act of entering a movie
        theater and watching a movie. In Laura Mulvey’s seminal film theory text,
        Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, the darkness of the cinema
        not only creates the illusion of anonymity amongst the film-going crowd,
        but it also facilitates voyeuristic desires that identification with the male film
        star <q>satisfies.</q> This <q>illusion of voyeuristic separation</q> (Mulvey 836) enables
        a central, pre-Oedipal misidentification, labeled by Lacan as the mirror
        stage, wherein the mirror self is confused as the ego ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery of a portal inside a cramped office on the seventh-and-a-half floor of an office building that leads to the mind of celebrity
        John Malkovich presents a unique opportunity for all three of Being
        John Malkovich’s central characters: for Maxine (Catherine Keener),
        the Malkovich body presents a lucrative business opportunity, a medium
        through which she can express her desire for Lotte; for Lotte (Cameron
        Diaz), the Malkovich body presents a male vessel through which she unearths
        her ostensibly contradictory desires to both be a mother and consumate
        her newly discovered same-sex desire; and for Craig, the Malkovich
        body presents an opportunity to express his desire for control and escape, a
        large-scale celebrity mimicry of his artsy yet saucy street corner puppetry.
        These motivations constitute the central cultural critique of the film. As
        Armond White writes in his review of the film, <q>The fantasy of being inside
        someone else’s skin in understood in contemporary terms as a sign of
        displacement and estranged desire &hellip; This becomes the basis of Jonze’s wild
        ride through Malkovich’s head, the escape from dread marital circumstances
        through the aura of celebrity.</q> For Craig, Lotte, Maxine and the people who
        pay to take the <q>wild ride,</q> the goal is not to simply be John Malkovich; it is
        to become someone, anyone else. Effectively the <q>commodity,</q> Malkovich’s
        body proxy <q>reveals itself to be a symptom of our desire to hear our split
        subjectivity by a return to pre-Oedipal plenitude</q> (Dragunoiu 14).
      </p>
      <p>
        Craig, Lotte and Maxine’s alienated displacement of desires update
        Laura Mulvey by suggesting a variety of relations to the film screen mirror.
        Specifically, Lotte and Maxine’s lesbian romance pokes fun at Mulvey
        by presenting the Malkovich celebrity body as the impetus for a psychological
        breakthrough—the same-sex desire that seemingly resolves Lotte’s
        sublimated parental desire and Maxine’s narcissism. After first inhabiting
        Malkovich, Lotte’s sudden suggestion that she is transsexual reveals a dilemma
        at the heart of Mulvey’s <q>implied male viewer</q> and also, ironically,
        resolves Lotte’s displaced desires and forces Maxine to confront her narcissistic
        manipulation. Lotte’s initial objectification of Maxine as an erotic
        object, while inside the Malkovich body, is also an objectification of the
        Malkovich body, whose status as a continuously misrecognized but universally
        lauded celebrity is an ironic subversion of the Classic Hollywood male
        movie star—and, importantly, an update of Mulvey’s analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        As White writes, in Being John Malkovich, “Art, acting, puppetry
        are skills of distance, alienation, lack of direct touch.” Craig’s puppets
        represent the human tendency to project desire onto representations
        which only “deepen our sense of alienation” (Wilkins 79). This, too, evokes
        Mulvey, who suggests that the act of looking “can become fixated into a
        perversion, producing obsessive voyeurs and Peeping Toms, whose only sexual
        satisfaction can come from watching, in an active controlling sense, an
        objectified other” (835). Craig’s puppetry exemplifies Mulvey’s perverted look by displacing his desires into his puppetry, objects who embody his
        desire for recognition and control, diverting his envious look. Through the
        constant manipulation of the Malkovich celebrity, Jonze teases Mulvey’s
        conception of male-female gazes when he conflates spectatorship and acting,
        the liminal space between the viewer in the darkened theater and the
        actor onscreen, whose reification presents a paradox of Mulveyean film theory—
        that the male movie star is simultaneously not an “erotic object of the
        gaze” but is the embodiment of the “more perfect, more complete, more
        powerful ideal ego” (Mulvey 838). In effect, the Malkovich body becomes
        both a celebrity vessel of Craig’s desire for artistic acknowledgment and an
        erotic vessel for Maxine and Lotte’s lesbian-by-penis-proxy affair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Importantly, Craig’s resentment of his rival Derek Mantini’s staging
        of William Luce’s The Belle of Amherst, a one-woman play about Emily
        Dickinson, evokes several ideas that are relevant to the meanings of the
        film: first, cultural images of well-known yet simultaneously obscure artists;
        second, recognition of artistic achievement; and, finally, displaced desire. In
        Sexual Personae, Camille Paglia writes that “No major figure in literary
        history has been more misunderstood” than Emily Dickinson, and the parallels
        that the film makes between Craig and Emily Dickinson are remarkably
        similar to the images of Dickinson created by both Luce’s play and Paglia’s
        essay on her. Like Dickinson, Craig recoils inward to perform his craft, sheltering
        himself in his basement and tucking away his vanity that fuels his
        artistic zeal. Luce provokes such images of private vanity and perfectionism
        from Dickinson, who when horrified at the prospect of dying without having
        published her work, she remarks, “No one must know that that famous
        and mysterious ‘E. Dickinson’ writes second and third drafts of her letters!”
        (Luce 41). Craig also channels his artistic and commercial obscurity into
        martyrdom. Like Dickinson, Craig “is an ostentatious flaunter of injuries”
        (Paglia 415), constantly reminded that he cannot have what he desires—
        whether it be by the beating he receives for his rude staging of the famously
        cloistered monastics Abelard and Héloïse (after which Lotte remarks, “Honey, not again!”); Maxine’s emasculating and homophobic belittling at The
        Stuck Pig, as well as her subsequent romance with Lotte; his bar brawl inside
        the Malkovich body; or by his consciousness itself. So it is no surprise when,
        in a conversation with Elijah, his chimpanzee, Craig condemns human consciousness
        as inherently sadomasochistic:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        You don’t know how lucky you are, being a monkey, because consciousness
        is a terrible curse. I think. I feel. I suffer. And all I ask
        in return is the opportunity to do my work. And they won’t allow
        it because I raise &hellip; issues.
      </blockquote>
      <p style="text-indent: 0em;">
        Vague and self-flagellating, Craig’s remarks confirm Paglia’s reading of
        Dickinson’s poems: “Who are ‘they’? No matter what reading we choose,
        we are left with a spectacle of Sadean torture. The speaker is a martyred
        saint &hellip; racked by the deputies of the state” (411). Additionally, Craig’s sado-
        martyrism reminds Jonze’s the film’s audience of Paglia’s reading that,
        for Dickinson, “Incarnation is torment. The soul, like the Greek winged psyche,
        is a butterfly fixed by a pin” (412). Craig’s consciousness is, horrifically,
        trapped by the flesh, a curse that a chimpanzee like Elijah could not possibly
        understand. (Apropos, we learn later, in a hilarious sequence that parodies
        Peter Gabriel’s “Shock the Monkey” and mocks psychoanalytic behavioral
        regimens, that Elijah suffers from trauma just the same as Craig.) Like
        Dickinson’s disembodied torturer, the viewer is left to surmise that Craig’s
        gatekeepers lie within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps most revealingly, in both Dickinson’s poetry and Craig’s
        puppetry, “things become persons and persons become things” (Paglia
        419). Rather than Craig’s artist cliché that he wants to “feel what another
        feels,” his puppetry “is not an exercise in empathy but a projection of control
        and self-interest” (Wilkins 79–80). Such an idea is best conveyed within
        the film by Craig’s “Dance of Disillusionment and Despair.” His “Dance of
        Despair and Disillusionment” is first performed by Craig as a wooden puppet at the beginning of the film, as Malkovich in the middle of the film and
        then as Malkovich as a human-sized puppet near the end. For the director
        Jonze, this is the ultimate conflation of spectator and actor, as Craig’s dance
        with a wooden—then flesh—puppet, in/as Malkovich, makes a person of
        an object and an object of a person. Craig, hopelessly “trapped” not only in
        his solipsism but in artistic obscurity, finds himself in what Dragunoiu calls
        a “historically feminine position” (9). Craig must, like Dickinson, “divide
        mind from body to embrace the Muse” (Paglia 420), whom he misidentifies
        as the erotic object Maxine (who uses her status as a sex object to manipulate
        both Craig and Lotte) but the film correctly identifies as the celebrity
        body of Malkovich. The film suggests that the celebrity body provides for
        Craig the opportunity of working-through his alienation and desire for control,
        which, metacinematically, makes the experience of film spectatorship
        precisely so attractive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, like Dickinson, Craig’s willing seclusion and disembodiment
        of desire inside the Malkovich body is self-hermaphroditic, monastic.
        The pleasure derived from the recognition of his artistry, his feeling of control
        inside the Malkovich-puppet-puppeteer, accompanies the pain that his
        acclaim requires the celebrity of the Malkovich body—a proxy to embrace
        his artistic will. He is neutered inside the male celebrity body. Therefore,
        Craig’s projection onto the celebrity puppet body clarifies and problematizes
        the act of film spectatorship as a “sexualized pleasure-pain,” that is,
        sadomasochism, a characteristic of “Dickinson’s iconography of suffering”
        (Paglia 414). In the film’s ending, once Craig’s identification with the
        Malkovich body has been ironically twisted, stuck inside the mind and body
        of Maxine’s infant daughter (aptly named Emily), the prospect of emotional
        projection and identification with the object-body erodes the pleasure of
        identification and leaves behind only the pain of misrecognition and obscurity.
        Craig’s solipsism, his inability to empathize with others, prevents
        him from examining himself, deepens his sense of alienation and leaves
        him trapped inside Malkovich’s then Emily’s infant body, perversely echoing Dickinson’s somewhat pathetic lament in The Belle of Amherst:
        “I wish we were always children!” (Luce 29; emphasis Luce’s). In this way,
        Luce’s lament and the central scenario of Being John Malkovich tie
        themselves to film theory through their connections to the pre-Oedipal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman’s sophisticated intertwining of
        subjects such as film theory, literary criticism, and popular culture constitutes
        not only a meta-cinematic reflection on film theory but also a close
        examination of why spectators watch movies, using the aura of celebrity
        around the peculiar actor John Malkovich as its satirical case-in-point, poking
        fun at the fascination with celebrities while pinpointing the source of
        such fascination in socioeconomic alienation. In Being John Malkovich, the
        combination of film theory and pop culture—traditionally framed as high
        and low culture—are not superficial; they are sophisticated and pertinent,
        showing audiences their mirrors in Craig, Lotte and Maxine while exposing
        their flaws, thereby asking the audience to re-consider why they attend the
        movies in the first place.

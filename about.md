#### Hi,
That's the Way It Is is a blog dedicated to one thing: writing about film as art. In our current moment the movie has been severely disregarded. Unfortunately, the most significant forms of popular art has been turned into yet another commodity by the techno-cultural empire of Hollywood. Perhaps more than ever, not only are movies not-so-discreet forms of Hollywood social engineering, they're also, perhaps paradoxically, pure spectacle--signs upon signs upon signs that don't mean anything, yet are blatantly political.

That's not to say that this blog isn't afraid to talk about politics. Though it's now vogue in the counterculture to disregard politics in the same way we disregard Hollywood-movie spectacle, it's important to remember that, like Robert Altman reminded us in his masterpiece *Nashville* (1975), politics are everywhere. You just have to know where to look, but you also have to know how to see--and that's the way it is.

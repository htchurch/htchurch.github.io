      <h1>Cookie's Fortune (Robert Altman, 1999)</h1>
      <p>Catfish enchilada-flavored little comedy with clever parallels to Salome that ends with tragic irony, at least for the conspiring Southern nosy-nancy Camille (Glenn Close). Yet the movie's relentlessly funny: insightful in the way that Altman reveals the complicated genealogy of people in the South, Cookie’s Fortune shows those connections and relationships that might seem totally unlikely anywhere else—just like the defense offered by Sheriff Lester Boyle (Ned Beatty) for Willis Richland, an African-American man wrongly accused of murder: “I’ve fished with him.” It's the perfect response from a culture that's also been unjustly accussed of wrongdoing, when things have gotten so much better. Cookie’s Fortune not only challenges the strictly white-black divisions that connote the South, but it also reveals insights into the bonds that anyone, anywhere can make—those complicated branches on the family tree.

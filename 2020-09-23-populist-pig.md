# Populist Pig

### The populism of *Pig in the City*

#### September 23, 2020

Despite the commercial success of the Mad Max films and the critical acclaim of the environmental propagandizing of Happy Feet, George Miller’s filmmaking was as never so precise—and artful—as it is in Babe: Pig in the City. In our current political moment, where revenge and enmity rule the political landscape—be it the professional anarchist class of wealthy, white, young people; ruling elites that break their own rules (like Nancy Pelosi’s secret spa day); or mob violence in the streets—Pig in the City answers our current political moment’s insanity with a small animal’s humanism.

Set just moments after the events of Babe, where little pig Babe wins acclaim for his sheepherding talent (really his unique ability to empathize), Pig in the City raises the stakes with an accident that leaves Farmer Hoggett and his farm under threat of ruin by bankers. A generous appearance fee provokes Mrs. Hoggett and Babe to leave for the city—but not before animal hijinks throws her entire plan into disarray, leaving her and the pig strayed in the big city and their home in danger.

In previous films, Miller’s political vision had never matched his kinetic frenzy. Mad Max: Fury Road tapped into obvious feminist themes, while Happy Feet’s obnoxious, bleeding-heart environmentalism goaded the Oscars to give him some attention. But the brilliance of Pig in the City is that Miller’s political commitments have never been less didactic: in this film, Miller’s filmmaking not only evokes populist themes; it’s also mildly spiritual, and clever.

The animals at the simply labeled HOTEL where Babe and Mrs. Hoggett stay embody sympathetic human failures and their outcomes, like the mistreated pink poodle prostitute (reminder: this movie was rated G by the MPAA) or the disabled, purblind Flealick, an aggressive, wheelchair-bound Jack Russell terrier. Though they all distinguish themselves by their animality, their proximity to human guile and folly gives them qualities that distinguish them from the stratified farm animals that filled the first film.
 
This time, empathy isn’t simplified. The film’s best subplot involves Thelonious (brilliantly voiced by James Cosmo), an orangutan whose affected accent and distinguished get-up signify desires beyond basic animal instinct—the desire to become human. These animals’ alienation both inspires the compassionate Babe to help and forms recognizable types that the audience can identify. That these eccentric pets aren’t so far away from the follies of humans is the point.
In Pig in the City, the unnamed city is a grab-bag of urban landscapes, blending Hollywood, New York, San Francisco, even Sydney, into a synecdoche that evokes all cities in all places. The focus here isn’t to romanticize the pastoral of the left-behind farm; instead, Miller’s focus is on urbanity’s ultra-capitalist, as well as spiritual, failures—those who are left behind, avoided, and forgotten. 

But Pig in the City is also about forgiveness. Far from the technical prowess of the rest of the film, which elevates its storybook construction, Miller’s best scene breaks through potentially maudlin material with genuinely moving empathy. After Babe saves his attacker, a bull terrier, from drowning, the terrier offers his collar as recompense; but when he laments, “A murderous shadow lies hard across my soul,” the film moves past the previous film’s one-note unsophistication into humane brilliance. 

And in this way, each new scene not only reveals new ways of seeing the world, using identifiable types and moral predicaments, but also new ways of seeing movies. 

Babe’s moral consistency in the film’s scenarios exposes the frailty of our own morality in everyday situations; what we once might have confused in Babe for childish naïveté Miller reveals as ethics—a concern for the well-being others that religious believers take seriously, which is abused by our powerful elites.

Over the last decade, moviegoers endured—and eventually succumbed to—Marvel-movie insanity. Now in the era of streaming, filmmakers look to cash-in on its conditioned audience with pointless movies that indulge the neuroses of the filmmaker, like Charlie Kaufman’s worst film, I’m Thinking of Ending Things; or movies with too much of a point, bordering on sociopolitical propaganda, like the race-baiting films of Jordan Peele. Both these filmmakers propagate our always-current political problem of solipsism. As fewer good movies are made, and more of our political discourse revolves around violence and revenge, it’s always good to remember a time when political and moral values could make for good art.

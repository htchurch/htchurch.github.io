      <h1>Crumb (Terry Zwigoff, 1994)</h1>
      <p>Limitations inherent in this form of film-making: we can tell that there’s more that these three brothers aren’t revealing about their obviously fucked-up childhood, but they’re each uniquely disturbed. Maxon’s ascetic lifestyle cloaks a past of molesting women and violent seizures; Charles, whose pedophilic desires probably explain why he’s never had sex, and among the Crumb brothers seems to harbor the most violent fantasies; and Robert’s misogyny manifests itself most famously through his behemoth, sometimes headless, women. Eventually, this documentary becomes entirely about sex and art, and how art can provide a sort of “therapy” for sexually aberrant fantasies, the sort that Zwigoff helps us become intimately familiar with, especially Robert's, whose incestuous, racist, and misogynistic cartoons stimulate most of the movie’s thoughtful contemplations on the subject.

    <p>The revelation for this documentary, then, passed through various critics and ex-lovers of Robert and the various interviews, is that the impetus of what Crumb’s twisted comix depict are on some level subconscious. Of course, this is not a remarkable discovery by any means, but by letting everyone simply talk, a picture is formed: Crumb’s dissatisfactions with the people around him, especially with America (he’s leaving with his wife and child for countryside France), is the result of a deeply disturbing childhood that soiled the images sold to him through mass-media advertising, the jilted fantasy that Crumb brazenly depicts in his fantastic deviant cartoons.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>But Zwigoff’s good enough to remind us that Crumb’s antisocial behavior is on some level warranted, even if what actually motivates Robert isn’t entirely known to him.

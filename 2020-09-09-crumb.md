# Crumb (Terry Zwigoff, 1994)
#### September 9, 2020
Limitations inherent in this form of film-making: we can tell that there's more that these three brothers aren't revealing about their obviously fucked-up childhood, but they're each uniquely disturbed. Maxon's ascetic lifestyle cloaks a past of molesting women; Charles is celibate because he's a pedophile, and admits to have harbored the desire to murder; and Robert's misogyny manifests itself most famously through his behemoth, sometimes headless, women––even children. Eventually this documentary becomes entirely about sex and art, and how art can provide a sort of "therapy" for the disturbed, like all three of the Crumb brothers, who come from a physically and sexually abusive household.

The revelation for this documentary, then, passed through various critics and ex-lovers of Robert and the various interviews, is that the impetus of what Crumb's twisted comix depict are on some level subconscious. This is not a remarkable discovery by any means, but by letting everyone simply talk, a picture is formed: Crumb's dissatisfactions with the people around him, and with America (he's leaving with his wife and child for France), is the result of a deeply disturbing childhood which soiled the images sold to him through corporate advertising but were remedied by the escapism of fantastic deviant drawings.

But Zwigoff's good enough to remind us that Crumb's antisocial behavior is on some level warranted, even if the edges of what actually motivates Robert isn't entirely drawn by him.

    <h1><i>Citizenfour</i> (2014)</h1>
    <h3>November 17 2020</h3>
    <p>It's been almost seven years since Ed Snowden blew the whistle on the fact that Democrats and Republicans, from time to time, team up to create the biggest police state known to man, using our phones, laptops, and credit cards (just to name a few). As Snowden presents himself as a idealistic guy whose experience for <i>Booz Allen Hamilton</i> as a NSA, CIA contractor revealed to him the (_insert secret police org here_)-like nature of our continuous, uninterrupted state of surveillance, the film reveals&mdash;perhaps unknowingly&mdash;about the ways in which our complicity in evil can sometimes be traced back to a sense of patriotism that's rooted in naivete about what exactly governments <i>do</i>. If we're to call Snowden a patriot, which I don't have a particular problem with, it's important to also make sure that we don't let people forget that stuff like this happens all the time, and is going to keep happening, as long as they keep buying into the CNN-FOX-ABC-MSNBC hegemony; it only makes me wonder how Snowden, tech-savvy and smart as he is, wouldn't have just assumed that our centralized intelligence agencies would merge with big corps to make American life only virtually free. Director Laura Poitras never thinks to ask&mdash;she's awestruck at the newest fish to fry.</p>

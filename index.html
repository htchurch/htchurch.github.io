            <p>I don't know what a stock is still, but I bought into AMC and Nokia (NOK) last night. Somehow, this will make me money, apparently, and though, of course, everything is rigged, it couldn't hurt to try and play the market &mdash; what's the worst that could happen &hellip; right?</p>

            Broken blossoms,
            descending the tree,
            flowing petals
            wandering free
            in the orange sky&mdash;

            January was never
            this tumultuous,
            heading into spring&mdash;
            glowing phosphorous.

            The reddest cherry.
            The red robin is
            the reddest berry.

            The wind cooling
            an apple pie in the window,
            only to be led astray
            by the pink flamingo,
            dining on plankton shrimp
            off Santo Domingo;

            by an ocean of jewels,
            an ocean made of plastic;
            lawn darts that circle the pool,
            floating fantastic.

            A beatitude
            undivined in
            statutes & laws.
            
            But that is all dogs do.
            A heeler, His palm:
            someone is God
            
            for the next two thousand years.
            I will read The Gospels without
            waiting for the time to come,
            
            when on a crackling path
            the New Word will hail down
            & arrange the world
            
            there on this map.
            There is a legend,
            there is a territory,
            
            which embraces a border,
            along which you may trek;
            although it is unsure now,
            
            all the paths washed away,
            in mud that is unsure & unfounded,
            commiserated instead.

            one branch in equation—
                a splitting computation.

                fiesta, little one.
            
            a prayer.
                null & void, legally.

            We could not live as
            a painting on an easel.

            We would have holes in our clothes.
            We would paint like an artist,
            with a precise amount 
                of carelessness.

            While the ship is sinking,
            we would grab all our money
            & burn it in front of us.

            We would land on land,
            in New York City,
            at harbor,

            & already a man would approach,
            on a bicycle, with an American flag,
            asking from us our porting tax;

            we would ask why; he would say, 
            that's another, for asking questions.

            He would say, I don't work for free,
            you know, and suddenly the decision
            to burn our money would look quite stupid,

            & the flames of General Washington
            would stink like we couldn't pretend
            anymore, damn our principles,

            as strutting, broke, through NYC
            we would notice it was made clearly

            with its own nostalgia in mind,
            but whose mind?—it has clay feet,
            it is meant to be knocked down,

            you are not meant to stay here
            as a statue: we would proselytize
            that we would be the king of bacteria.

            I want to be like a fallen statue!
            I am Nebuchadnezzar!
            I want to have been there when I fall!

            —a million times over, like pigeons.

            Sometimes I do not walk barefoot in the grass,
            on the blades, wreathing between my toes,
            towards the stubborn tree trunk,
            to whom I suppose I should compare myself.

            I will not compare myself to a stubborn tree,
            because a stubborn tree does not grow;
            a real tree will always manage, somehow,
            to extend itself wherever it may please.

            Any nesting bird may twig my hair and lay
            its eggs & feed its babies (but I will not look)
            as they will learn to fly & partake in a grand tradition
            of falling & picking yourself right back up.

            Sometimes I will walk on all fours, my hands equal to my feet;
            they all sturdy me & the ground senses me & the rabbits
            scurry towards the high grass & I form a mold
            out of which only I can be cast.

            <h3>Minus Eleven</h3>
            <p>Reddit lied to me. I am currently down $11. This is my Vietnam War. A war without end, without purpose. I am in the heart of darkness.</p>
            <p>But, speaking of the Vietnam War, the heart of darkness, I just yesterday watched <em>The Deer Hunter</em> (1978), directed by Michael Cimino and starring Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep. I posted my take on it on my <a href="https://www.letterboxd.com/htxkkb">Letterboxd</a>, but I will post the review here, too:</p>
            <blockquote>
              One of the biggest complaints about this movie that is totally fair to lodge &mdash; that isn't about it being <q>too long,</q> a side effect of over-diagnosed ADHD Letterboxd brains &mdash; is that the highs of this movie are so great, and Cimino's direction is so brilliant in parts, and all of the actors are doing their best, considering that their characters aren't much to work with, truthfully, but the movie, while anti-war, really and truly doesn't know what kind of moral attitude it really wants to have about all the totally brutal scenes that happen during the middle of the film. [It's oddly structured, with a too Romantic jump from total terror, with the escape from a Vietnamese torture camp (the Vietcong are portrayed with Yellow Terror xenophobia, like aliens) to the awkward sexual chastity back in middle America.]
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              But this is a wonderful film, honestly on-par with the much-lauded Apocalypse Now, if only because we aren't allowed to see a civilian world in Apocalypse Now &mdash; where [as Baudrillard <a href="https://disquietthoughts.blogspot.com/2007/11/baudrillard-on-apocalypse-now.html">suggests</a>] Coppola is caught up in the spectacle of war &mdash; in The Deer Hunter the spacious world from America to Vietnam becomes a testament to the spaciousness of our own capabilities under the <q>heart of darkness.</q> Perhaps the brutality of De Niro's character in Vietnam is a extrapolation of his pent-up sexual energies. If only Cimino was able to articulate a position more fully developed, then who knows, maybe more people would talk about The Deer Hunter like they do about Apocalypse Now, but what's here is already pretty near great.

            in the orange sky&mdash;

            The reddest cherry.
            The red robin is
            the reddest berry.

            The wind cooling
            an apple pie in the window,
            only to be led astray
            by the pink flamingo,
            dining on plankton shrimp
            off Santo Domingo;

            by an ocean of jewels,
            an ocean made of plastic;
            lawn darts that circle the pool,
            floating fantastic.

            someone is God
            
            for the next two thousand years.
            I will read The Gospels without
            waiting for the time to come,
            
            when on a crackling path
            the New Word will hail down
            & arrange the world
            
            there on this map.
            There is a legend,
            there is a territory,
            
            which embraces a border,
            along which you may trek;
            although it is unsure now,
            
            all the paths washed away,
            in mud that is unsure & unfounded,
            commiserated instead.

            <div class="section"><pre>
            We could not live as
            a painting on an easel.

            We would have holes in our clothes.
            We would paint like an artist,
            with a precise amount 
                of carelessness.

            While the ship is sinking,
            we would grab all our money
            & burn it in front of us.

            We would land on land,
            in New York City,
            at harbor,

            & already a man would approach,
            on a bicycle, with an American flag,
            asking from us our porting tax;

            we would ask why; he would say, 
            that's another, for asking questions.

            He would say, I don't work for free,
            you know, and suddenly the decision
            to burn our money would look quite stupid,

            & the flames of General Washington
            would stink like we couldn't pretend
            anymore, damn our principles,

            as strutting, broke, through NYC
            we would notice it was made clearly

            with its own nostalgia in mind,
            but whose mind?—it has clay feet,
            it is meant to be knocked down,

            you are not meant to stay here
            as a statue: we would proselytize
            that we would be the king of bacteria.

            I want to be like a fallen statue!
            I am Nebuchadnezzar!
            I want to have been there when I fall!

            —a million times over, like pigeons.

            <pre style="margin-top: 2.3em;">
            Sometimes I do not walk barefoot in the grass,
            on the blades, wreathing between my toes,
            towards the stubborn tree trunk,
            to whom I suppose I should compare myself.

            I will not compare myself to a stubborn tree,
            because a stubborn tree does not grow;
            a real tree will always manage, somehow,
            to extend itself wherever it may please.

            Any nesting bird may twig my hair and lay
            its eggs & feed its babies (but I will not look)
            as they will learn to fly & partake in a grand tradition
            of falling & picking yourself right back up.

            Sometimes I will walk on all fours, my hands equal to my feet;
            they all sturdy me & the ground senses me & the rabbits
            scurry towards the high grass & I form a mold
            out of which only I can be cast.

<h2>Tenet (Christopher Nolan, 2020)</h2>
  
<p>Never has a spy seemed so clueless as John David Washington’s “Protagonist,” one of Chris Nolan’s several meta-genre conceits that are all poorly executed in Tenet. Our nameless Protagonist seems for the most part to have—if you would allow me to use a wonderful Southern phrase—fallen off the turnip truck just yesterday, a flat response to everything hurled towards him, from time-travel to a predicament which one character calls “worse than nuclear holocaust.”</p>
<p>Washington’s face doesn’t read indescribable, in that he’s enigmatic; he just seems bored. Even some of Nolan’s most clever lines, like Washington’s reply to Michael Caine, “You overestimate my powers of seduction,” which both teases James Bond’s canonical lustiness and racist black American stereotypes, appear on Washington’s face as though he were breaking bad news to someone, an indication that Nolan himself perhaps didn’t intend such moments of cultural self-awareness.
</p>
<p>But of course Nolan isn’t really concerned with politics or culture; he never really is. Once again, Nolan has attempted to fool audiences with a hack filmmaker’s technological spectacle. As time, Nolan’s crutch, moves both forwards and backwards, any overarching plot becomes moot. That’s because Nolan’s intricate plotting, which earlier films like Memento required, here fall flat because Nolan’s films forget humanity, pretend philosophical depth, and enable braindead nihilism—a problem only exaggerated through his penchant for filmmaking mindfuckery. Forget the horrendously mixed soundtrack—I got a headache from everything else.

We could not live as
a painting on an easel.

We would have holes in our clothes.
We would paint like an artist,
with a precise amount 
	of carelessness.

While the ship is sinking,
we would grab all our money
& burn it in front of us.

We would land on land,
in New York City,
at harbor,

& already a man would approach,
on a bicycle, with an American flag,
asking from us our porting tax;

we would ask why; he would say, 
that's another, for asking questions.

He would say, I don't work for free,
you know, and suddenly the decision
to burn our money would look quite stupid,

& the flames of General Washington
would stink like we couldn't pretend
anymore, damn our principles,

as strutting, broke, through NYC
we would notice it was made clearly

with its own nostalgia in mind,
but whose mind?—it has clay feet,
it is meant to be knocked down,

you are not meant to stay here
as a statue: we would proselytize
that we would be the king of bacteria.

I want to be like a fallen statue!
I am Nebuchadnezzar!
I want to have been there when I fall!

—a million times over, like pigeons.

Sometimes I do not walk barefoot in the grass,
on the blades, wreathing between my toes,
towards the stubborn tree trunk,
to whom I suppose I should compare myself.

I will not compare myself to a stubborn tree,
because a stubborn tree does not grow;
a real tree will always manage, somehow,
to extend itself wherever it may please.

Any nesting bird may twig my hair and lay
its eggs & feed its babies (but I will not look)
as they will learn to fly & partake in a grand tradition
of falling & picking yourself right back up.

Sometimes I will walk on all fours, my hands equal to my feet;
they all sturdy me & the ground senses me & the rabbits
scurry towards the high grass & I form a mold
out of which only I can be cast.

# Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)
#### September 19, 2020
As imperfect as it was, the original Blade Runner had an ingenuity to it; noir, "cyberpunk," and meta-consumerism formed that film's dystopia. Ridley Scott's advertising savvy turned that pulp nightmare into sci-fi chic. These humane elements of film convention grounded the super-advanced technology of trashworld Earth into something that was simultaneously glossy yet dirty.

Skipping out on those pulpy genre roots, BR2049's design, contradistinctly, is elaborate and ornate. The story is largely the same, when you get right down to it, but the film's fascination with technology, rather than psychology, skimps out on the depth of the oft-maligned original cut of Blade Runner. So, if the OC of Blade Runner was blue, BR2049 is orange, but aesthetics can only get you so far.

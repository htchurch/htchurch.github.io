# Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)
As imperfect as it was, the original Blade Runner had an ingenuity to it; noir, "cyberpunk," and meta-consumerist formed that film's dystopia with Ridley Scott's advertising vision that turned nightmare into chic. These humane elements of film tradition grounded the super-advanced technology into something that was simultaneously glossy yet dirty--and trashy.

Skipping out on those pulpy genre roots, BR2049's design is elaborate and ornate. The story, however, is largely the same, but the film's fascination with technology, rather than psychology, skimps on the depth of the original BR (and yes, I mean the original-original). So if BR was blue, BR2049 is orange--apples and oranges--but aesthetics can only get you so far.

        JB opens with a series of postcards, which are at once a little cutting
        and scornful but in an admittedly funny way — not in a way that reeks of
        JB's politics per se, but of an outsider who's come to visit, stayed for
        a little while and is reporting back to friends back home. I think of
        this section almost like Thomas Jefferson in France, in
        <strong>Notes on Virginia</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do wonder whose religion JB is referring to when he suggests that a
        &quot;terribly cruel religion&quot; would have been needed &quot;to
        exorcize such a theoretical grandeur as the deserts' geological and
        celestial occurrence, to live up to such a backdrop&quot; (3). The
        Indians? The Mormons, whose architectural achievements in Salt Lake City
        he had just referred to as &quot;pompous&quot;? The Catholics? The
        Protestants?
      </p>
      <p>
        He seems to suggest to that speed, which is, itself, a pure object,
        cancels out the present, the desert, but that doesn't stop what JB calls
        &quot;fossil sounds&quot; from awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baudrillard suggests a contrasting relationship between the U.S.'
        short-sightedness (speed) and its &quot;primitiveness&quot; — that is,
        its inherent rootlessness. Here Baudrillard posits that &quot;speed is
        the triumph of effect over cause,&quot; a &quot;rite&quot; of
        nothingness that aims to bring the natural world back to immobility. (7)
      </p>
      <p>
        For this, he focuses on the &quot;rich-living, puritanical
        conquistadors, the Mormons&quot; and the flatness of both space and time
        that high-speed cars seem to crush.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Still, there is a violent contast here, in [the US], between the
          growing abstractness of a nuclear universe and a primary, visceral,
          unbounded vitality, springing not from rootedness, but from a lack of
          roots, a metabolic vitality, in sex and bodies, as well as in work and
          in buying and selling. Deep down, the US … is the
          <em>only remaining primitive society</em>. (7)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So, America is a place that negates and dissipates its own emptiness,
        its vast stretches of <strong>land</strong>. But the desert itself
        &mdash; and by extension, I suppose, forestry and trees, mountains and
        hills &mdash; is a &quot;negative of the earth's surface and of our
        civilized humours.&quot; (6)
      </p>
      <p>
        JB makes an observation which is a little confusing here but one that is
        worth considering—even if it really doesn't hold up historically:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Only Puritans could have invented and developed this ecological
          andbiological morality based on preservation&mdash;and therefore on
          discrimination&mdash;which is profoundly racial in nature. Everything
          becomes an overprotected nature reserve, so protected indeed that
          there is talk today of denaturalizing Yosemite to give it back to
          Nature, as has happened with the Tasaday in the Philippines. A Puritan
          obsession with origins in the very place where the ground itself has
          already gone. An obsession with finding a niche, a contact, precisely
          at the point where everything unfolds in an astral indifference. (8)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Not sure what JB means when he talks about the so-called &quot;efforts
        to denaturalize Yosemite to give it back to Nature&quot; (8) since my
        sense of what &quot;denaturalization&quot; is is counterintuitive to
        what I know JB must mean here: that America is
        &quot;overprotective&quot; of its nature because it is naturally, so to
        speak, Puritanical. If he doesn't mean that America
        <em>as a whole</em> is Puritanical — rather, just the desert, the
        unsettled lands more broadly are so uncultivated due the
        "discriminatory" (name any nation that doesn't discriminate) tendency of
        the Latter-Day Saints who trekked out there, only to leave it mostly
        untouched — then I can see that point-of-view, too.

      <h1>A Question of Refinement</h1>
      <p>
        is a book of poems set in a unconventional world, a world of refined folks and creatures, including: a Hollywood cowboy, John Brown, a fascist dog, Marie Antoinette, Jesus in kabuki makeup, a man with a beard. A book which will make you cry, laugh, and cry from laughter. Looking at both the mundane and the insane, A Question of Refinement sees the world from a different&mdash;even peculiar&mdash;point of view.

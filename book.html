      <h2>A Question of Refinement</h2>
      <p>
        is a book of poems set in a unconventional world, a world of refined
        folks and creatures, including: a Hollywood cowboy, John Brown, a
        fascist dog, Marie Antoinette, Jesus in kabuki makeup, a man with a
        beard. A book which will make you cry, laugh, and cry from laughter.
        Looking at both the mundane and the insane,
        <em>A Question of Refinement</em>
        sees the world from a different&mdash;even peculiar&mdash;point of view.

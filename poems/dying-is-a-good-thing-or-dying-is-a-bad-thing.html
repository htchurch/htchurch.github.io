    <div id="poemdiv">
    <p>The picture frame was not even tapped into the wall<br>
      with a couple of well-placed hammer blows;<br>
      it was guided, carefully, hung on plastic tip pushpins<br>
      for cork boards, the trailer walls were so soft.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        A baby on a tractor with big tires,<br>
a red one being steered by his grandfather,<br>
whose face now’s dusty (and that’s wiped off)<br>
as a thumbprint’s been in their faces.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The grandfather’s smiling and wearing glasses<br>
that aren’t sharp—not even orthogonal,<br>
more rounded and oval, and they sit on his face,<br>
which is smiling, holding the baby who’s pointing<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        toward someone not the cameraperson,<br>
wearing a onesie with teddy bears on it:<br>
they’re plopped down there incongruous but cute,<br>
red but not tractor red, fire hydrant red, China red.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Clay like the fields, more like, which another man<br>
now gets out and tills, in a little sunhat, sunglasses<br>
that blacken everything, like memory fading black<br>
without the moon to catch it all slipping away.<br>
